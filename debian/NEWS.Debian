qdbm (1.8.78-1) unstable; urgency=low

    gdbm emulation (hovel) is dropped from this version (cf. #620550).
    It breaks symbol versioning policy to keep its old version despite
    dropping gdbm_* symbols, assuming nobody use it.
    If you've used its functionarity, please switch to gdbm, or rebuild
    source package removing "--disable-gdbm" flag.
